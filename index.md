# About KIRI

> Global warming. Heavy traffic. High fuel cost.

Those are three examples of current problems, which actually can be solved by the Indonesia local public transport. Nevertheles, there are still many people hesitate to use them, mostly because it is less practical than riding a private vehicle. Ironically, tourists from neighbouring countries prefer to use the public transports, as they are cheaper and give a chance to see the city.

KIRIâ€™s role is very simple: you tell us where you are and where to go, and we tell you how, by using angkots. Either you are a tourist or local people who wants to help reduce the problems mentioned before.
